# Common container images

Container images that might be used in different projects.

The goal is to have some pre-built containers for software that is not commonly used and recent packages might be missing from some linux distributions. 


## Security Notice

No special security precautions were taken. Assessing the security of an image is the sole responsibility of the user.

Most containers here are provided with a default "working" configuration but otherwise have no special restrictions. Again as stated before the goal here is to have the sofr=tware available in various evironments and NOT to have sane/secure defaults.

Please inspect refer to each of the upstream software manuals/documentation on how to secure them.

## Project structure
Each software is contained in it's own directory where you will typically the Dockerfile used to create the container and configuration files(if any). 

## The "why"

Each of the images contains may a small section explaining why it is here.
